### Project Ideas:
- Gravity simulator using BabylonJS/WebGL
  - Similar to the game I played as a kid on the Mac LC II
- Music visualizer, web-based, VR
- Expanded typing game with vanilla JS and Babylon visuals
- Automate a square garden, potentially using machine learning in the future to recognize plants
- Logo generator using machine learning, based on keywords
  - Search Google Images for logos to then generate the logo
